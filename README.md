# Minesweeper
A classic minesweeper game with three levels of difficulty. Attempt to clear the minefield by revealing all non-mine cells.

## How to Play
Reveal cells by clicking the left mouse button. When a cell is revealed, it will display a number representing how many neighbouring cells contain a mine.

Right-clicking a cell will cycle through several "flags", allowing you to mark cells as suspected mines.

The game is won when all cells not containing mines have been revealed.

When the game is over, click anywhere in the minefield to return to the difficulty selection screen.

## Difficulty

The game has three difficulty levels, which determine the size of the minefield and the number of mines placed.
